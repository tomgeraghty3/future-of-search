# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a customer-facing search agent that provides personalized information retrieval for both logged-in customers and anonymous visitors. The agent leverages AWS services including Bedrock Knowledge Base, AgentCore Runtime, AgentCore Gateway and Bedrock Guardrails to deliver safe, accurate, and contextually relevant search results in a structured JSON format.

## Glossary

- **Search Agent**: The AI-powered system that processes natural language queries and returns structured information
- **Bedrock Knowledge Base**: AWS managed service that stores and retrieves domain-specific information using vector search
- **AgentCore Runtime**: AWS serverless platform for deploying and scaling AI agents
- **AgentCore Gateway**: Service that transforms existing APIs into agent tools accessible via MCP protocol
- **Bedrock Guardrails**: AWS service that filters harmful content and ensures response quality
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Amazon Bedrock foundation model used for natural language processing
- **Strands Framework**: Development framework for building AI agents
- **RetrieveAndGenerate API**: Bedrock service that combines retrieval and generation for knowledge-based responses
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for authenticated customers
- **Anonymous Visitor**: User accessing the system without authentication
- **Logged-in Customer**: Authenticated user with a valid User ID

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anonymous visitor, I want to search for information using natural language, so that I can get relevant summaries and source links without needing to log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous visitor submits a search query with empty User ID, THE Search Agent SHALL process the query using the RetrieveAndGenerate API in Bedrock Knowledge Base
2. THE Search Agent SHALL return a JSON response with populated "summary" and "links" fields and empty "personalised" field
3. THE Search Agent SHALL complete the response within 2 seconds average latency
4. THE Search Agent SHALL base all summaries on actual snippets from the Bedrock Knowledge Base
5. THE Search Agent SHALL include at least one cited source in the "links" field when relevant information is found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in customer, I want to receive personalized search results based on my profile, so that I can get information tailored to my specific situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in customer submits a search query with valid User ID, THE Search Agent SHALL process the query using the RetrieveAndGenerate API in Bedrock Knowledge Base
2. THE Search Agent SHALL query available tools in the AgentCore Gateway to find relevant personalization options
3. IF a relevant tool exists for the topic, THE Search Agent SHALL invoke the tool with the User ID and populate the "personalised" field
4. IF no relevant tool exists for the topic, THE Search Agent SHALL return empty "personalised" field
5. THE Search Agent SHALL return a JSON response with populated "summary", "links", and "personalised" fields when applicable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to prevent harmful or fabricated content, so that users receive safe and accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search Agent SHALL process all responses through Bedrock Guardrails before returning to users
2. THE Search Agent SHALL never fabricate facts, policies, or prices in responses
3. THE Search Agent SHALL prefer retrieved snippets over generated content for factual information
4. IF Bedrock Guardrails blocks a response, THE Search Agent SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. THE Search Agent SHALL ensure all responses are coherent and contextually appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to return structured JSON responses, so that I can easily integrate the results into client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search Agent SHALL return responses in JSON format with exactly three fields: "personalised", "summary", and "links"
2. THE Search Agent SHALL populate the "summary" field with content derived from Bedrock Knowledge Base retrieval
3. THE Search Agent SHALL populate the "links" field as an array of strings containing source URLs from citations
4. THE Search Agent SHALL populate the "personalised" field only for logged-in customers with relevant personalization data
5. THE Search Agent SHALL ensure all JSON responses are valid and properly formatted

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to monitor agent performance metrics, so that I can ensure the system meets quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search Agent SHALL achieve average response latency of no more than 2 seconds
2. THE Search Agent SHALL base 100% of factual responses on actual snippets from the Bedrock Knowledge Base
3. THE Search Agent SHALL include at least one cited source in 95% of successful responses
4. THE Search Agent SHALL successfully stream coherent answers from Claude 3.7 Sonnet for all valid queries
5. THE Search Agent SHALL utilize AgentCore Gateway for personalization when relevant tools are available and User ID is provided

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the agent to handle errors gracefully, so that users receive helpful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Bedrock Knowledge Base is unavailable, THE Search Agent SHALL return an appropriate error message
2. WHEN AgentCore Gateway tools are unavailable, THE Search Agent SHALL continue processing with empty "personalised" field
3. WHEN invalid input parameters are provided, THE Search Agent SHALL return validation error messages
4. THE Search Agent SHALL log all errors for monitoring and debugging purposes
5. THE Search Agent SHALL maintain system availability even when individual components fail
