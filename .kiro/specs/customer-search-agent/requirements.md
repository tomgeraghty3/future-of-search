# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A customer-facing search agent that provides intelligent information retrieval for both logged-in customers and anonymous visitors. The agent leverages AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base for content retrieval, Claude 3.7 Sonnet for natural language processing, AWS AgentCore Runtime for deployment, AWS AgentCore Gateway for personalisation tools, and AWS Bedrock Guardrails for content safety. The system returns structured JSON responses containing general summaries, personalised insights, and source citations.

## Glossary

- **Search_Agent**: The customer-facing intelligent search system
- **Strands_Framework**: The AI agent development framework used to build the Search_Agent
- **Bedrock_Knowledge_Base**: AWS managed vector database containing searchable content
- **AgentCore_Runtime**: AWS serverless platform for deploying and scaling AI agents
- **AgentCore_Gateway**: MCP server that provides access to external tools and APIs
- **Bedrock_Guardrails**: AWS service for content safety and response validation
- **Claude_Sonnet**: Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet large language model accessed via AWS Bedrock
- **RetrieveAndGenerate_API**: AWS Bedrock API for knowledge base querying and response generation using Bedrock_Knowledge_Base
- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for authenticated customers
- **Anonymous_Visitor**: Unauthenticated user without a User_ID
- **Logged_Customer**: Authenticated user with a valid User_ID

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an anonymous visitor, I want to search for information using natural language, so that I can quickly find relevant content without needing to log in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Anonymous_Visitor submits a search query without a User_ID, THE Search_Agent SHALL process the query using the RetrieveAndGenerate_API
2. THE Search_Agent SHALL return a JSON response containing summary and links fields with personalised field empty
3. IF no relevant content exists in the Bedrock_Knowledge_Base, THEN THE Search_Agent SHALL return "No AI summary could be found for the specified query" in the summary field
4. THE Search_Agent SHALL complete the response within 2 seconds average latency
5. THE Search_Agent SHALL validate all responses using Bedrock_Guardrails before returning to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in customer, I want to receive personalised search results based on my profile, so that I can get information tailored to my specific situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Logged_Customer submits a search query with a valid User_ID, THE Search_Agent SHALL perform the exact same behaviour as an Anonymous_Visitor (e.g. process the query using the RetrieveAndGenerate_API in Bedrock_Knowledge_Base)
2. THE Search_Agent SHALL query available tools in the AgentCore_Gateway to find the most relevant personalisation tool for the search topic
3. IF a relevant personalisation tool exists, THEN THE Search_Agent SHALL invoke the tool with the User_ID and populate the personalised field
4. IF no relevant personalisation tool exists, THEN THE Search_Agent SHALL leave the personalised field empty
5. THE Search_Agent SHALL return a complete JSON response with summary, personalised, and links fields populated as appropriate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive accurate information with proper source citations, so that I can verify the information and explore related content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search_Agent SHALL base all responses exclusively on content retrieved from the Bedrock_Knowledge_Base
2. THE Search_Agent SHALL extract and return source citations as a list of strings in the links field
3. THE Search_Agent SHALL never fabricate facts, policies, or prices not present in the retrieved content
4. THE Search_Agent SHALL exclude terms like "search results" from response content
5. THE Search_Agent SHALL ensure all summary content references actual snippets from the knowledge base

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the agent to handle errors gracefully and maintain consistent performance, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search_Agent SHALL handle both authenticated and unauthenticated requests without errors
2. WHEN the RetrieveAndGenerate_API fails, THE Search_Agent SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN the AgentCore_Gateway is unavailable, THE Search_Agent SHALL continue processing with empty personalised field
4. THE Search_Agent SHALL log all interactions for monitoring and debugging purposes
5. THE Search_Agent SHALL maintain average response latency of 2 seconds or less

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the agent to return responses in a consistent JSON format, so that I can reliably parse and display the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search_Agent SHALL return all responses as valid JSON containing exactly three fields: personalised, summary, and links
2. THE Search_Agent SHALL populate the summary field with content derived from the Bedrock_Knowledge_Base
3. THE Search_Agent SHALL populate the links field as an array of strings containing source URLs
4. WHEN a User_ID is provided and personalisation is available, THE Search_Agent SHALL populate the personalised field with user-specific content
5. WHEN no User_ID is provided or no personalisation is available, THE Search_Agent SHALL set the personalised field as an empty string

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to track agent performance metrics, so that I can evaluate effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Search_Agent SHALL track responses based on actual Bedrock_Knowledge_Base snippets
2. THE Search_Agent SHALL measure and report response latency for each query
3. THE Search_Agent SHALL log successful citations and source link extractions
4. THE Search_Agent SHALL monitor AgentCore_Gateway tool usage for personalisation
5. THE Search_Agent SHALL track Bedrock_Guardrails validation results for safety compliance
